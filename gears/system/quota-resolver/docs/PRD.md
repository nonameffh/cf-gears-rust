## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Quota Resolver is the entry point through which CF modules charge and read quotas. It offers three capabilities:

* **debit**: charge an amount of a metric;
* **lease**: hold capacity, then settle it with commit or release;
* **quota state**: read the current state of quotas.

The capabilities are split across two planes:

* the **platform plane** offers all three: a platform service names the tenant and the subjects. A module that serves
  a user request takes that user's principal and tenant from the request's `SecurityContext` and passes them as
  request data;
* the **tenant plane** offers quota state only: the subject is the authenticated principal itself and the tenant is
  that principal's tenant.

A subject is either a quota subject or a principal. The resolver maps a principal to a quota subject from operator
configuration, so no calling module needs to know the operator's quota subject types.

The resolver owns no counters, quotas, or leases. It delegates every operation to a quota backend plugin that it
selects at runtime. Subject forms and principal mapping follow license-resolver, so a module that checks licenses and
charges quotas passes a principal to both in the same way.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Many modules charge quotas for the work they do: model tokens, API calls, stored objects. They all need the same entry
point: charge an amount, reserve capacity before work whose cost is known only afterwards and settle it later, and
read what remains. Without one, each module integrates with the quota backend on its own terms and repeats the same
logic.

Two needs shape this entry point:

* The most common subject of a quota is the principal that makes the request, for example a user who spends model
  tokens. A calling module knows the principal type from `SecurityContext`, but it does not know which quota subject
  type the operator uses for that kind of principal. Without a shared mapping, each module repeats the operator's
  mapping.
* A module that serves a user request charges that user, and the user wants to see their own remaining quota. Neither
  should require a policy grant for every user.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

* One quota contract for all consuming modules, independent of the backend that holds the quota state.
* The operator states the principal mapping in one place; no caller code changes when it changes.
* An authenticated user can read their own quota state without any extra policy grant.
* No operation is allowed by default: a missing plugin, an unavailable backend, or a failed mapping lookup ends in an
  error, and a principal that is not mapped ends in a denial for a debit or a lease acquisition and an empty page for
  a quota state read, in 100% of cases.

### 1.4 Glossary

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Principal        | Whoever authenticated: a person, a service account, a system actor. `SecurityContext` carries its type (the **principal type**, a GTS type id), its id, and its tenant. |
| Quota subject    | Whom a quota applies to: a quota subject type (a GTS type id derived from the resolver's quota subject base, for example a user or a tenant type) and an opaque id.  |
| Principal form   | A subject given as a principal type and a principal id. The resolver maps it to a quota subject.                                                                       |
| Metric           | A registered GTS instance id that names what is counted, for example model tokens.                                                                                     |
| Lease            | A hold on capacity for a bounded time, settled by commit (charge what was used) or release (charge nothing), or released when it expires.                              |
| Decision         | The verdict of a debit or a lease acquisition: allowed or denied. A denial is a successful call, not an error.                                                        |
| Platform plane   | Calls authenticated as a platform service (`PlatformSecurityContext`). The service is trusted to name the tenant and the subjects.                                     |
| Tenant plane     | Calls that carry the caller's `SecurityContext`; quota state only. The subject and the tenant come from that context only.                                             |
| Edge             | The api-gateway entry for clients outside the platform. Only routes published there are reachable from outside.                                                        |
| Plugin           | A quota backend implementation, discovered through types-registry, that executes the operations.                                                                       |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### End User

**ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-end-user`

- **Role**: An authenticated principal that reads the state of its own quotas through the edge.
- **Needs**: Remaining capacity and the next reset time for the metrics it uses.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Consuming Module

**ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

- **Role**: A CF module that charges quotas for the work it does. It calls the platform plane with its own service
credential. To charge the principal whose request it serves, it takes that principal's type, id, and tenant from the
request's `SecurityContext` and passes them as request data.

#### Quota Backend Plugin

**ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-backend-plugin`

- **Role**: A backend that owns quotas, counters, and leases and executes the delegated operations.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

This module introduces no environment constraints beyond project defaults: see
[docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md](../../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md) and [guidelines/](../../../../guidelines/).

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

* Debit of one metric for a set of subjects in one tenant.
* Lease acquisition, commit, and release.
* Quota state of the quotas that apply to given subjects and metrics.
* Mapping a principal to a quota subject from operator configuration.
* All operations on the platform plane; quota state on the tenant plane.
* Selection of a backend plugin and delegation to it.

### 4.2 Out of Scope

* The backend's other operations, such as quota and policy management: they stay in the backend's own API.
* Storage of quotas, counters, leases, and idempotency records.
* Quota evaluation and arbitration between several quotas.
* Authorization of platform-plane callers by the policy decision point.
* Quota notifications.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Quota Operations

#### Debit

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-debit`

The system **MUST** charge a positive amount of one metric for a set of subjects in one tenant and return a decision.
An allowed decision means the amount is charged; a denied decision means nothing is charged.

- **Rationale**: Modules charge consumption after or while doing work.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

#### Lease

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-lease`

The system **MUST** acquire a lease on an amount of one metric for a set of subjects for a requested time, and return
either a lease token and its expiry or a denied decision. The system **MUST** commit a lease for an actual amount not
above the held amount, and release a lease without a charge. A commit or release that succeeds returns no result; one
that cannot be applied, for example because the lease has expired or the amount exceeds the held amount, **MUST**
fail with an error and change nothing.

- **Rationale**: Modules that learn the real cost only after the work (for example, generated tokens) must reserve
capacity first.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

#### Quota State

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-quota-state`

The system **MUST** return, for one subject and given metrics in one tenant, the state of every quota that the
backend applies to them: cap, consumed amount, remaining amount, and the current period with its reset time. The
backend decides which quotas apply, including quotas of the tenant; the resolver returns the backend's page unchanged.

- **Rationale**: Modules and users must see remaining capacity before they start work.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`, `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-end-user`

#### Idempotent Writes

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-idempotency`

Debit, lease acquisition, commit, and release **MUST** require an idempotency key and pass it to the backend
unchanged. A repeated call with the same key that reaches the backend **MUST** return the first result and charge
nothing again. The outcome for a principal that is not mapped is decided again on every call and charges nothing.

- **Rationale**: Callers retry after timeouts; a retry must not charge twice.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

### 5.2 Subjects and Planes

#### Subject Forms

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-subject-forms`

A platform-plane request **MUST** accept each subject either as a quota subject or in the principal form.

- **Rationale**: A module charges both principals and subjects that are not principals, such as a device or an agent.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

#### Principal Mapping

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-principal-mapping`

The system **MUST** map a principal type to a quota subject type from operator configuration: an entry for the type
itself wins, otherwise the entry of its nearest ancestor applies. A principal that is not mapped or has a nil id
**MUST** make a debit or a lease acquisition denied and a quota state read empty, without a call to the backend. A
tenant-plane caller with a nil tenant **MUST** get an empty quota state page, without a call to the backend.

- **Rationale**: The operator decides which principals take part in quotas; the module does not know the operator's
quota subject types.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`, `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-end-user`

#### Platform Plane

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-platform-plane`

The platform plane **MUST** offer debit, lease acquisition, commit, release, and quota state. It **MUST** be callable
only with a platform service credential and **MUST NOT** be reachable from the edge. The tenant and the subjects come
from the request. A module that charges the principal of a user request passes that principal and its tenant as
request data, taken from the request's `SecurityContext`; the user's `SecurityContext` is neither forwarded nor
synthesized.

- **Rationale**: Only platform services charge quotas, for any subject of any tenant they serve. Passing the user's
principal as data keeps one authentication model for every charge: the platform credential of the calling module.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

#### Tenant Plane

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-tenant-plane`

The tenant plane **MUST** offer quota state only. It **MUST** take the subject only from the caller's principal and
the tenant only from the caller's tenant; the request **MUST NOT** carry fields that name either. It **MUST** be
reachable from the edge by any authenticated principal.

- **Rationale**: A user reads their own quotas without a policy grant. Only the module that does the work is
authorized to charge, because it decides the metric and the amount; the user is not.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`, `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-end-user`

### 5.3 Backend

#### Plugin Delegation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-plugin-delegation`

The system **MUST** execute every operation through a backend plugin discovered through types-registry and selected by
vendor and priority, and **MUST NOT** store quota data itself.

- **Rationale**: Quota state belongs to the backend; consuming modules must not depend on a particular backend.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-backend-plugin`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

Project baselines: [docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md](../../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md) and
[guidelines/](../../../../guidelines/).

### 6.1 Gear-Specific NFRs

#### Fail Closed

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-nfr-fail-closed`

The system **MUST NOT** return an allowed decision or a lease when no plugin matches, the backend is unavailable, or
the principal mapping cannot be resolved.

- **Threshold**: 0 allowed decisions across these conditions.
- **Rationale**: Allowing by default lets consumption run past the budget.

#### Tenant Scoping

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-nfr-tenant-scoping`

Every plugin call **MUST** carry exactly one tenant: the request's tenant on the platform plane, the caller's tenant
on the tenant plane.

- **Threshold**: 0 plugin calls with a tenant other than the one this rule names.
- **Rationale**: Quotas are tenant data.

#### Resolver Overhead

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-nfr-overhead`

The time the resolver adds to an operation, excluding the plugin call, **MUST** be at most 5 ms at p95 with warm
caches.

- **Threshold**: ≤ 5 ms p95 at the resolver boundary, plugin time excluded.
- **Rationale**: Debit and lease sit on the request path of the consuming module.

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

* Data durability and backup: not applicable, the resolver stores no data.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

#### Quota Resolver Client

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-interface-client`

- **Type**: Two Rust traits in the SDK crate, one per plane, each with a REST projection: the platform plane under
`/quota-resolver/v1/platform`, the tenant plane under `/quota-resolver/v1`, as in types-registry.
- **Stability**: unstable.
- **Description**: Platform plane: debit, lease acquire, commit, release, and quota state. Tenant plane: quota state,
with the same operation name.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Major version bump of the contract.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Backend Plugin Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-contract-backend-plugin`

- **Direction**: required from the plugin.
- **Protocol/Format**: in-process Rust trait. Requests carry the tenant and quota subjects only, never a principal.
- **Compatibility**: Major version bump of the plugin contract for any breaking change.

## 8. Use Cases

### Charge a User for Generated Tokens

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-usecase-lease-for-user`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

**Preconditions**:
- The operator maps the user principal type to a quota subject type, and a quota exists for that type and the
  metric.

**Main Flow**:
1. The module receives a user request with the user's `SecurityContext`.
2. It takes the user's principal type, id, and tenant from that context and acquires a lease for the estimated tokens
   on the platform plane, with the subject in the principal form.
3. It runs the work and commits the lease on the platform plane for the tokens actually used.

**Postconditions**:
- The quotas that the backend applies to the user are charged once for the used tokens.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Denied**: the module refuses the user request and charges nothing.
- **Work fails**: the module releases the lease, or the lease expires.

### Show a User Their Remaining Quota

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-usecase-own-quota-state`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-end-user`

**Preconditions**:
- The user is authenticated.

**Main Flow**:
1. The user requests their quota state for some metrics through the edge.
2. The system returns the state of the quotas that the backend applies to the user's mapped subject on those metrics.

**Postconditions**:
- Nothing changes.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Principal not mapped**: the page is empty.

### Check a User's Quota Before Work

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-usecase-module-reads-user-quota`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

**Preconditions**:
- The module serves a user request with the user's `SecurityContext`.

**Main Flow**:
1. Before it starts the work, the module reads quota state on the tenant plane with the user's `SecurityContext`, for
   the metrics the work consumes.
2. The system returns the state of the quotas that the backend applies to the user's mapped subject on those metrics.
3. The module starts the work, or tells the user that no capacity remains.

**Postconditions**:
- Nothing changes.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Principal not mapped**: the page is empty.

### Charge a User from a Background Job

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-usecase-job-debit`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-actor-consuming-module`

**Preconditions**:
- The job knows the user's principal type, id, and tenant.

**Main Flow**:
1. The job debits on the platform plane with the subject in the principal form.
2. The system maps the principal and delegates.

**Postconditions**:
- The quotas that the backend applies to the user are charged.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A module charges the user of a request on the platform plane, with the subject in the principal form, without
naming a quota subject type.
- [ ] A user reads their own quota state through the edge; the tenant plane has no debit or lease operation.
- [ ] A principal that is not mapped is denied a debit or a lease acquisition and gets an empty quota state page,
without a backend call.
- [ ] With no plugin or an unavailable backend, no operation returns an allowed decision or a lease.

## 10. Dependencies

| Dependency            | Description                                                                     | Criticality |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| types-registry        | Plugin discovery; ancestors of principal types for the mapping                  | p1          |
| Quota backend plugin  | Quotas, counters, leases, idempotency, and evaluation                           | p1          |
| AuthN and api-gateway | `SecurityContext` and `PlatformSecurityContext` of the caller; edge publication | p1          |

## 11. Assumptions

* Principal types are GTS types that derive from a platform principal base, so their ancestors resolve in
  types-registry (issue #5446).
* A platform-plane caller is trusted to name the tenant and the subjects, as for other platform-plane resolvers.

## 12. Risks

| Risk                                                       | Impact                                       | Mitigation                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A platform service charges the wrong subject               | Wrong quota charged                          | Platform plane only for platform services; the principal of a user request comes from its `SecurityContext` |
| The mapping points to a type the metric does not admit     | Every debit for that principal type fails    | The backend rejects it as an invalid request; the resolver logs the misconfiguration |
