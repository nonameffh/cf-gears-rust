## Context and Problem Statement

Two kinds of callers charge and read quotas. A platform service acts for any subject of any tenant it serves, for
example a background job. A module that serves a user request charges that user, and the user wants to see their own
quotas. A backend that authorizes every call through the policy decision point against the calling service would need
a policy grant for each module and each kind of subject it charges. Which plane carries which operation, how does
a module charge the user of a request, and which operations are reachable from the edge?

## Decision Drivers

* A platform service names the tenant and the subjects; it is trusted, as on the platform plane of other resolvers.
* A call on behalf of the caller must not let the caller name another subject or tenant.
* A user reads their own quotas without a policy grant.
* Only the module that does the work is authorized to charge, because it decides the metric and the amount; the user
  whose work is charged is not.
* A charge has one authentication model, whoever its subject is.

## Considered Options

* (a) Writes on the platform plane only, the user's principal passed as request data; the tenant plane offers quota
  state only and is published at the edge.
* (b) Writes on both planes: on the tenant plane the module forwards the user's `SecurityContext`, and the
  tenant-plane write routes are internal.
* (c) As (a), but the resolver passes caller security context through the plugin contract and prescribes a policy
  check in the backend.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: (a). Each plane is its own contract with its own base path, as in types-registry
(`PlatformTypesRegistryApi` under `/types-registry/v2/platform`, `TypesRegistryApi` under `/types-registry/v2`).

| Plane    | Contract                   | Base path                     | Operations                                          | Subject and tenant    | Edge          |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Platform | `PlatformQuotaResolverApi` | `/quota-resolver/v1/platform` | debit, acquire, commit, release lease; quota state  | from the request      | not published |
| Tenant   | `QuotaResolverApi`         | `/quota-resolver/v1`          | quota state                                         | from the context only | published     |

`PlatformQuotaResolverApi` takes `PlatformSecurityContext`; `QuotaResolverApi` takes `SecurityContext`, and its
request has no subject or tenant field.

A module that serves a user request and charges that user calls the platform plane with its own platform credential.
It takes the user's principal type, id, and tenant from the incoming `SecurityContext` and passes them as request
data: the subject in the principal form, the tenant as a request field. The user's `SecurityContext` is
neither forwarded to the resolver nor synthesized by it. The resolver maps the principal as in
`cpt-cf-quota-resolver-adr-principal-subject-mapping`.

On the tenant plane the subject is the caller's principal, mapped the same way, and the tenant is the caller's tenant.

The resolver performs no policy check and passes no caller identity to the plugin. It trusts platform-plane callers
for the target data they provide and trusts the backend to decide which quotas apply to the fixed tenant and subjects.

### Consequences

* Only platform services can charge. A module charges the user of a request with the same call it uses for any other
  subject; the SDK offers a helper that builds the principal subject and the tenant from a `SecurityContext`.
* The resolver cannot check that a principal passed as data is the user of the module's request; it trusts the
  platform-plane caller, as for any other subject.
* A backend that also has its own API gains a second entry into its operations: the in-process plugin.
* An authenticated user receives the state of the quotas that the backend applies to the mapped subject and requested
  metrics, including quotas of the tenant. The resolver returns the backend's page unchanged.

### Confirmation

OpenAPI: `QuotaResolverApi` has only the quota state route, with `x-toolkit-visibility: exposed`; every
`PlatformQuotaResolverApi` route is internal. Tests: a tenant-plane request cannot change the subject or the tenant;
the resolver returns the plugin's quota-state page unchanged.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### (a) Platform-plane writes, principal as data

* Good, because a user cannot charge, by any route.
* Good, because every charge is authenticated the same way, by the platform credential of the calling module.
* Good, because the tenant plane is read-only and safe to publish at the edge.
* Bad, because the resolver trusts the module to pass the right principal.
* Bad, because the backend secures its plugin entry point itself.

### (b) Writes on both planes, user context forwarded

* Good, because the resolver takes the principal from an authenticated context, not from request data.
* Bad, because a charge has two authentication models, and a user's bearer token would reach write routes that only
  their being internal keeps away from the user.
* Bad, because the contract doubles: every write exists on both planes.

### (c) Caller security context in the plugin contract

* Good, because the resolver can prescribe one explicit policy-check mechanism for every backend.
* Bad, because the plugin contract would carry the caller's `SecurityContext` and leak backend authorization concerns
  into the resolver.
* Bad, because every module could require policy grants for every user it serves.

## Traceability

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../PRD.md)
- **DESIGN**: [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md)

This decision directly addresses the following requirements or design elements:

* `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-platform-plane` — every write is on the platform plane; the principal is request data.
* `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-fr-tenant-plane` — quota state only; subject and tenant come from the context; published at
  the edge.
* `cpt-cf-quota-resolver-nfr-tenant-scoping` — the tenant plane takes the tenant from the context.
